MATLAB Simulink model of microgrid system
This repository contains a modular MATLAB Simulink model for simulating the dynamic operation of a microgrid composed of:

Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) using an Online UPS
Diesel Generator (DG)
Isolated Battery Charger (Soft Charging Circuit)
Main Grid Supply
Loads
It simulates both black start and islanded scenarios, providing a detailed understanding of microgrid control, voltage and frequency stability, and load sharing.


Folder	Description
